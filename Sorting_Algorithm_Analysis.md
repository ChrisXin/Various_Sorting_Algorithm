# Various_Sorting_Algorithm


Insertion_Sort:



Q(n ln(n)) Sorting Algorithm:

HeapSort:
         allows in-place sorting

MergeSort:
         is faster but requires more memory
         
QuickSort:  
         - (On average faster than heap sort or merge sort)
         - Using the median of three pivots is a reasonably means of finding the pivot
         - Use a pivot in the array to divide the two sub array
         - Average-case run-time:	Q(n ln(n)) time 
         - Average-case Memory:        Q(ln(n)) memory 
         - Worst-case run-time:	Q(n^2) time (it happens when you pick the minimum element as pivot)
         - Worst-case Memory:          Q(n) memory  (it happens when you pick the minimum element as pivot)
